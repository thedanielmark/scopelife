        <h3>STRATEGIC INTERVENTION POLICIES AND PRACTICES: APPROACH MODEL – I </h3>
        </div>
        </div>

<div class="row drarup-content">  
<br>  
<p>First; the ‘SCOPE’ strives to unearth the detrimental factors, reform institutions, influence decision makers, mobilize citizens and undertakes programs to <span class="greensub"> 'alleviate those factors from its root’,</span> causing so much sufferings for the people and planet alike, for which we’re forced to forfeit our fundamental rights of good health, lasting peace and sustainable progress!</p><br>

<p>Secondly, providing the <span class="greensub">  ‘best alternative solutions with an enabling condition’ </span> while trying to mitigate the challenges and not just removing the ‘detrimental factors’ responsible for sufferings. Removing detrimental factors only paves the way for the citizens to see the difference and adopt some of the better alternatives. Interestingly; these alternatives are neither enforced nor enumerated, rather developed in co-ordination with citizens at their own context.</p><br>

<p>Thirdly; <span class="greensub"> ‘harnesses inter-community strengths’</span> as a strategic steps to bringing communities together with a shared vision and common goals that produce greater unity.  ‘SCOPE’ practices and believes that <span class="greensub">‘true unity comes through diversity’</span> and only that unity lasts!</p><br>
 
<p>Fourthly; carrying out <span class="greensub">‘People Centric Advocacy’,</span> meaning it’s not just creating an awareness and influencing the decision makers to act but leaves enough and lasting foot-prints for the community members to carry on even after we withdraw from the field. Meaning to say that the citizens are prepared to take up the ownership of the progressive change they want and hence will not depend on outside assistance for ever;<p>

<p>Fifthly; <span class="greensub">‘developing partnership drawing on innovation’, </span> incorporating several development agencies, think-tanks, research orgs, medical practitioners, scientists and social engineers including the most ordinary citizens like <span class="greensub">children or even a humble cobbler on the road.</span> ‘SCOPE’ believes that real <span class="greensub">‘development happens in co-ordination and never in isolation’,</span> which is why all beneficiaries must be engaged in the process of finding solutions rather than just being part of the challenges;</p><br>

<p>Sixthly; raising and training children and youth as <span class="greensub">character driven global citizens</span> through forming <span class="greensub">‘Citizens Parliaments’ - (CPAN)</span> at various levels which is a peace-building alternative non-political platform with an enabling condition that <span class="greensub">enhances ordinary citizens to emerge as global leaders,</span> who would be instrumental in transforming nations struggling to achieve lasting peace, holistic health and sustainable development. The <span class="greensub">‘CPAN’ system develops leaders and simply does not assume to be there;</span></p><br> 

<p>Seventhly; providing <span class="greensub"> ‘market-based solutions to health-care services’</span> for those who can afford it, and facilitating the business-corporate houses in their ‘mission driven investments’.</p><br>
