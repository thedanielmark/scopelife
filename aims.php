    <li>Reaching the <span class="greensub">health-care products & services at the community door steps</span> which is a <span class="greensub">crucial link between social stigma, community health and poverty.</span> Logically speaking health-care facilities aren’t accessible by many of the adolescent girls and women because of the cultural-backwardness in a patriarchal society…especially if the health-care services are provided by male practitioners; </li>
    <li>Promoting a <span class="greensub">‘Holistic Lifestyle’</span> by adopting a planet friendly sustainable practices of food productions…without using toxic substance…to improve nutritional values and simultaneously improve soil health. Harnessing renewable energy and promoting large-scale social forestry…to keep the carbon foot-print at a very low, harvesting and managing natural resources, water governance, waste management (W2W), using eco-friendly clothing while  performing socio-cultural, religious functions are part of our programs; </li>
    <li>Promoting <span class="greensub">‘Tobacco-free School Zones, Children’s Play Area with Recreational Activities’</span>  encouraging <span class="greensub">kids of different faith to come, participate and form relationship…<span class="greensub">all these  lead to develop a <span class="greensub">‘Healthy Environment with Lasting Peace’</span> in the neighborhood, as these factors  intrinsically impact  the health (ESL) and future performances of the children!</li>
    <li><span class="greensub">‘Influencing the Decisions-Policy Makers and Community Institutes’</span> ensuring social and environmental justice based on equity, economy and sustainability, enabling all the stake-holders to participate in the decision making process, thus creating an opportunity for all to reduce carbon footprint and moving towards fulfilling SDGs by 2030. </li>
