        <p class="slogan">The ‘Society for Community Organisation & Peoples Education’ – <span class="slogan-sub">(SCOPE) is a -for-Profit Centre for ensuring Social Justice with Education, Community-based Healthcare Management, Local Economic Development and Rehabilitation of the victims with a wholistic approach’.</span> The ‘SCOPE’ has five major areas of targeted interventions: <span class="slogan-sub">‘Holistic Development of Children; Advancing Initiatives for Girls & Women; Community-based Holistic Health Management; Re-building Local Economy; and Good Governance with Gender Justice’.</span></p>

        <p class="slogan">
            Our journey began as <span class="slogan-sub">‘Community-based Health-care Service Provider & Rehabilitation’</span> for the persons affected with Leprosy, TB, and HIV/AIDS including children. We were faced with <span class="slogan-sub">Two Major Social Challenges:</span> the<span class="slogan-sub"> ‘Stigma and Community Norms’</span> against these sufferers, forcing them to live in seclusion amidst life threatening situations barring them from public life, common water resources, labour market and socio-cultural activities; and Secondly; the <span class="slogan-sub">‘Social Injustices against the Children and Women’ </span> belonging to Tribal and socio-economically most marginalized communities without education, food and shelter forcing them to resort to unsafe economic migration that often ends up in human trafficking especially girls and women become victims of economic & sexual exploitations aggravating the causes of HIV/AIDS. Back at home they face gender discrimination, early marriage, domestic & gender-based violence etc…are the direct results of <span class="slogan-sub"> social injustices with gender imbalance for which there’s a high prevalence of these diseases, hunger and malnutrition in the District.</span></p><br>

        <p class="slogan">The lessons we’ve learnt from the above facts are that <span class="slogan-sub"> without education especially for girls, improving local economy and change of social norms through institutional reformation,</span>no amount of efforts can contain these diseases, hunger, early marriage, human trafficking in person, exploitations and violence in multiple forms! For it’s proven that an <span class="slogan-sub"> extra year of girls’ education reduces poverty by 39% and more, </span> apart from controlling GBVs, early marriage, family size and women’s reproductive health problem. It further enables their participation in local governance & decision making power to bring in the changes in community norms and gender balancing… <span class="slogan-sub"> towards achieving at least 6 of 17 SDGs by 2030. </span> </p><br>

        <p class="slogan">Thus, ‘SCOPE’ was born with the missions to mobilize and empower communities at various levels leading to mass awareness and change of social behaviours against stigma, discrimination and injustices primarily through health-care, education and skill development. The ‘SCOPE’ reaches-out to the affected victims of the infectious diseases through <span class="slogan-sub"> ‘Active Search, Mass Education & Treatment (ASET), and Rehabilitation with Alternative Livelihood’ </span> and implements a <span class="slogan-sub"> Comprehensive Education Program for the children especially girls; Women’s Reproductive & Holistic Health Management; Micro Finance; Legal and Financial Literacy for Adults; and Skill Development </span> that supports sustainable food productions with water governance and alternative livelihood for the disabled victims, women and farmers of the most marginalized in the District.
