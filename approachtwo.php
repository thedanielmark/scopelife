<p>Developing <span class="greensub">‘Gender-just Thriving Local Communities’ </span>needs both preventive & progressive actions. A preventive – male attitude towards women and relationship with all others; and progressive – a sustainable community lifestyle. People will be healthy if the planet is healthy since both are intrinsically connected, and to achieve it requires responsible collective actions that starts with the development of  <span class="greensub">‘Collective Human Social Capitals & Intelligence’ – (CHSC&I) </span> powered by specially designed curriculum with a value system that includes  <span class="greensub"> equal justice, non-violence and rule of law.</span> It’s equally important the way we build and the path it takes to develop our communities have a profound effect on our physical and mental health…</p><br>

<p>To fulfill these parameters  <span class="greensub">‘Citizen’s Parliaments’-(CPAN)</span> perfectly lays the ground by collectivizing the most un-organized citizens into a unified force on a common vision with shared goals. One of the main objectives of ‘CPAN’ is to create an  <span class="greensub">‘enabling condition’ </span> for the citizens to equally and freely participate and contribute their talents & resources towards development. This system enables developing  <span class="greensub">'Character driven global leaders’</span> we call them  <span class="greensub">‘Ambassadors of Peace & Holistic Health’.</span> They’re the drivers of real change to ensure health, wellbeing and rule of law…ultimately the  <span class="greensub">lasting peace</span> that sustains the development.</p>
