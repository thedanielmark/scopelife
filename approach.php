<p>Data driven evidence based <span class="greensub">‘systems thinking approach’ </span> that enables us to deepen our understanding about the complex and interconnected social, economic and political environment in which we plan to bring about a positive change, shapes our <span class="greensub">‘strategic planning with a framework’</span> and strengthens our capacity to create an enduring impact;</p><br>

<p>Secondly, to gain clarity about the challenges we explore the<span class="greensub">factors develop the paradigm </span> on which a challenge manifests, and <span class="greensub">the forces that set the pattern of the causes </span> rather than the simple manifestation of an issue, helping us to prepare a framework;</p><br>

<p>Thirdly, involving all the<span class="greensub"> stakeholders is a crucial leverage point </span> and above all an opportunity to share the collective wisdom in multiplying the impact, as they retain the ownership and so the solutions become a replicable cum 
applicable model in other geogr aphic areas facing similar challenges;</p><br>

<p>Fourthly, the mission-driven approach is also to mitigate the challenges such as social stigma etc <span class="greensub">to a manageable level…in case of the factors that can’t be completely alleviated </span> due to some other social factors; </p><br>

<p>Fifthly; we take full advantage of the lessons we learn and remain open to alternative and better avenues that increase our <span class="greensub"> ability to foster development and bring in enduring social changes.</span></p><br>
