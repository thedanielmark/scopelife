    <li>To <span class="greensub"> alleviate Leprosy, HIV, TB, Palsy </span> etc as diseases using ‘SET’ methodology (survey, education and treatment) and <span class="greensub">eradicate the socio-economic exclusion and religio-cultural stigma by reforming community institutions</span> where the govt. has failed or incapable of changing it so, by educating and empowering the communities;</li>
    <li>To<span class="greensub"> pursue the govt. to include ‘HHM’</span> - (Holistic Health Management) <span class="greensub">as ‘compulsory school curriculum’</span> as there’re rising pediatric tuberculosis, liver and lungs related diseases that remain highly under diagnosed, food habits, life style and stress related learning disabilities etc which are a serious deterrent to the future generation;</li>
    <li>To <span class="greensub">develop resilience </span> within the communities by mobilizing, educating and adopting villages and townships that often get affected by seasonal, water and air borne diseases and disrupt lives; study the pattern, gather vital data and create mass awareness using relevant information;</li>
    <li>To establish <<span class="greensub">‘Citizen’s Parliaments’ </span> by raising and training women, youth and children as volunteers and watch keeping forces among the target villages and townships as pre-emptive and preventive measures before many a predictable and non-predictable natural calamities and out-break of diseases occur and disrupt community health, livelihood and local economy;</li>
    <li>To emerge as <span class="greensub">‘Resource Providers for Holistic Health Management’</span> – as we develop <span class="greensub">‘Data-base Health Profile’ </span> as tool making it available to scientists, social engineers, researchers, community health workers and the govt decision making bodies and it also enables all our NPO partners to adopt and scale up the development of healthy communities anywhere in India and elsewhere;</li>
    <li>To<span class="greensub"> ‘Improve Health Governance’ </span> that ensures medical assistance and services reaching to the beneficiaries with a special <span class="greensub">emphasis to the ones who can’t afford it </span> while  working with community institutes and leaders of local and state administrations;</li>
    <li>To  <span class="greensub">‘Re-build Local Economy’ - (LED)</span> using local resources essential to improve income generation and employment opportunities that alleviate intergenerational poverty by organizing the most unorganized labourers, farmers and housewives, ensuring   <span class="greensub">their accessibility to social goods like health-care, education and nutrition </span> needs for their children and also enable them to contribute to the community welfare;</li>
    <li>To impart <span class="greensub">‘crucial health education’</span> especially to the <span class="greensub"> domestic helps and sex workers </span> as they’re not only the direct victims but remain as <span class="greensub"> primary and secondary vectors </span> for several communicable diseases like HIV/AIDS, TB & Leprosy etc.</li>
